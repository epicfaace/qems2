        <h4>Instructions:</h4>
        <p>Type questions into the box on the type questions tab. Questions must be formatted properly or the parser will reject them.</p>
        <p>Answers should be wrapped with _underscores_.  Italicize titles by using ~tildes~.  Pronunciation guides use (parentheses), unless the parentheses are escaped with \(backslahses\).  Superscripts follow the format \SMy Superscript Text\S.  Subscripts follow the format \sMy subscript text\s.  You may type multiple questions at once.</p>
        <p>You can tag your question with a category by adding {Category - Subcategory} to the end of any answer line.</p>
        <h4>Example Tossup:</h4>
        <p>The only man from the House of Hesse to hold this title gained the throne when his wife abdicated in his favor in 1715; that man nominally ruled during the so-called Age of Freedom and was named Frederick I. A man who tried to hold this title simultaneously with King of Poland and Lithuania lost the title in 1599 due to his Catholicism. That man in this position was Sigismund, who was a member of the (*) Vasa Dynasty started by the “father of the nation” who broke his country away from the Kalmar Union. Another man to hold this title saw his country’s army defeated in the Battle of Poltava, part of the Great Northern War. For 10 points, give this title held by monarchs like Charles XII and Gustavus Adolphus.<br />
